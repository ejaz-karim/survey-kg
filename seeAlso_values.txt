The MusicBo Pilot aims to investigate the role that music played in the life of the city of Bologna through a historical perspective in terms of performances, encounters between musicians, composers, critics and historians. The pilot focuses on the testimonies of scholars, journalists, travelers, writers and students from medieval to modern times through published documents showing diverse discourse styles such as stories, letters, reports, news, reportage. The pilot aims to represetnt the link between cultural heritage of Bologna and musical facts.
time and accuracy with which tasks are carried out
- Is there a connection between place and type of sound?-Is there a connection between type of instrument (materials, forms, date of construction) and type of sound?-Is there a connection between type of structures and type of sound?-Is there a connection between instrument, place, occasion and type of performing?-Which is the impact of changing sound practices (from manual execution to electrical ones)to soundscape?-Which is the type of transmission of practices from generation to generation? Is there a formalized knowledge ?Can we formalize it through a conceptual model? 
• Improved or new kinds of engagement• New forms of access• Proven ability to engage with music in new ways• Illuminating feedback from potential users
Of course the output will be an interpretation (editorial work) but there is no need for making explicit this process in the data.

If there exists a KO system for musical instruments, we might want to build on that. But probably, it will be necessary to design one specifically for texts about (historical) pipe organs.

Entity recognition (time), Knowledge extraction from text
Factual knowledge about specific instruments, and factual knowledge about the connections between instruments and specific entities (such as organ builders). ; At a more abstract level we would like to be able to infer historic knowledge about trends, influences, longitudinal developments. E.g. why and how did the German organ building tradition virtually replace the Dutch tradition around 1700?

A work of integration of existing Italian vocabularies  for campanology domain has been partially carried out, as well as a work of recognition of existing vocabularies connected to local repertoires and performing techniques. A collection of 100 bell-sound recordings has been acquired and the catalogation activities are in progress: for every sound recording we are describing the related performing technique and cataloguing  the bells used and the bell tower, enriching existing ontologies for cultural heritage (as Ar.Co). Additional 400 sound documents in analog format have been acquired and will be digitized. 
Provide an interface for annotation and analytical argumentation. This interface would  - Classify musical works into modal-tonal categories on the basis of an in-depth understanding of their inner organisation;- Apply different theoretical models to identify how the work’s modal-tonal interpretation changes through the lense of a given theoretical framework;- Confront modal-tonal attributions of a musical work;- Look “inside” modal-tonal theories and compare them;  - Provide an argued, documented and authored modal-tonal analysis on the basis of the theoretical and analytical observations made.
This pilot is rather different in character from the other pilots, as it focuses on improving engagement with musical performances and activities for those with hearing and other disabilities, with a focus on a particular musical venue and music festival. There are ways in which this pilot could encompass more digital aspects, but it is too early to specify such aspects, if any, as they would depend in part on the user community.

Knowledge related to musical heritage in Bologna as data about musicians, performances and buildings
Yes, especially when dealing with music similarities.
The new knowledge is anchored to a specific fragment in a source (e.g. "The note identified by the xml:id "m-69" in a MEI file is analyzed as a passing note");The new knowledge is about a whole document (e.g. "The composer of this piece is H.I.F. von Biber").

Librarians, indexing music collections.
Method: knowledge extraction tailored to support historiographical methodology.
TONALITIES will investigate modal-tonal identification, exploration and classification of monophonic and polyphonic notated music from the Renaissance to the 20th century. We believe that a better understanding of tonality requires a computer-assisted serial analysis of large corpora. The digital approach, in order to be petinent and adapted, must however reintroduce and clarify the analyst's  (theoretical, philosophical, historical) point of view. To this end, we implement an approach that combines collaborative annotation of scores and deep learning.
Starting from 2 data points:  sound recording and instrument and their place (bells/bell tower) the pilot will build connection to intangible elements like performing practices, transmission practices, sound characteristics (e.g. bells nominal notes) and tangible elements (e.g bells measurements, materials, etc),  through the use of existing and new controled vocabularies.

Algorithm for retrieval and extraction of events and accounts relevant to music and childhood
Facets' goal is to develop an open-source search engine for symbolic music (digital scores). The pilot will have the capability of indexing several formats of scores, index them, and rank the results. It will be distributed as a user-friendly docker image, enabling anyone to index and search their own scores. Analysis of indexed score may be done as a bonus. Several interfaces will be provided.

Knowledge related to interrelations within European melodic heritage.

There is envisioned overlap with TONALITIES and INTERLINK.Also with FACETS.
Bells pilot aims to reconnect tangible and intangible elements that are part of "bell heritage" to the wider context of a landscape and cultural heritage. The pilot aims to investigate the intrinsic complexity of this heritage with an interdisciplinary approach, its cultural dimension in relation to a wider culture of sounds and listening, and the correlation of knowledge, practices and symbolic orders that preside over this dimension, with particular attention to the ethno-anthropological and ethnomusicological perspectives. The research will be articulated through two different lines of investigation: i) recovery, possible digitization and analysis of sound, audiovisual and written sources, already existing in collections and archives, ii) field surveys and catalogation of bell towers, bells, bell sound recordings,  performing practices and related knowledge. In particular, we will consider: the nature of the bell as a music instruments, the social actors traditionally involved in performing practices, the execution techniques and the performances and their interconnections and developments over time and space.

Most of the sources are born digitally, others were digitized externally to the project.
Nationaal Instituut voor de Orgelkunst (National Institute for Organ Art): Data provider. Maintainer of target database. Publisher of the Organ Encyclopaedia.
Yes, several theoretical models have been modeled (Praetorius 1619, Zarlino 1558) or will be modeled in the future (Meeùs 2003)

The resulting knowledge also will be incorporated in the database of pipeorgan.nl. The portal could link to that.
General terms from music theory should be used. To my knowledge, there is only little vocabulary for describing melodies. This is a limitation in music theory that could be addressed by our results (in relation with WP3)
With a Linked Data browser
Links between melodies from different geographic and historical origins. Mainly factual and historical knowledge.
Network: knowledge graph on historical pipe organs in the Netherlands.
Knowledge expressed in reports, images ,videos, etc.
The new knowledge is anchored to a specific fragment in a source. This may be a note, a verticality, a melodic pattern, a fragment of a bar or more, the root bass of a work. The units are not necessarily adjacent. The new knowledge is anchored to a specific fragment in a source (e.g. "The note identified by the xml:id "m-69" in a MEI file is analyzed as a passing note");
A well-trained algorithm probably could, but at the moment we don’t think so.
Some sources will be recorded on the field, and they will be digital born records. The existing sources have been digitized from analog supports. Other sources are still in analog support (mainly tapes)
What level of meta data do we need on musical scores to classify them?What musical content can we process to produce an efficient search-engine?How should we design a search-engine interface for musical content?
Some preliminary research questions are:(a) how children experienced differ across time, culture, and gender?(b) how children were involved in musical learning?(c) how cultural studies in music can provide a lens to analyse how the idea of childhood evolved in time?(d) how to characterise the distinction between the point of view of adults and the point of view of children?
Yes (SPARQL endpoint)
We plan a validation of the pilot (UI, search quality) by external experts. We aim to involve Polifonia experts (through WP3) in selecting relevant similarity measures and patterns for the search engine.
WP2: Help in ontology design and alignment. Strategies for ontology-based reasoningWP3: Help in the design/training of a neural network for rate analysisWP5: Contribution to the design of the collaborative annotation interface.

Not yet clear.
Analytical knowledge is produced through theoretical constructs that are based on hypotheses and are the result of certain assumptions. 
Can we link MIDI and audio representations of the same works? Does this help in establishing/improving provenance information? Can we trace the international origins of this Dutch popular song from the 16th century to other countries and cultures? Do any of these Dutch popular songs appear in modern, 20th century TV programs? Is there evidence of recurring patterns between popular and art music in different places and periods? 
Contributes new tools and methods for building a KG of historical meetups. The resources contributes to historical musicology research.
we plan a first demonstration of the Pilot - through a beta version of the app - during the European researchers' night in September
Keoma
XML, RDF, MAG and other formats
Knowledge is included in the text, research in WP4 has the aim of extracting/curating it.
We will rely on partial results from WP2 with ontologies. Some categories will be created by emerging from the data.
musicologists, historians, linguistics, art historian, cultural studies in music
Partially Some sources will be recorded on the field, and they will be digital born records. The existing sources have been digitized from analog supports. Other sources are still in analog support (mainly tapes)
1. Does the theoretical model allow for the correct inference of modal attributions?2. Is the analytical information provided by user(s) or computed by algorithms correctly stored and retrievable ?3. Can the argumentative chain be correctly reconstructed?4. Does the music annotation environment meet usability requirements ?
By contributing  new tools, frameworks, perspectives and an understanding of their effects.
n/a
Musical score parsing. And adequate clustering or ranking models (information retrieval).
Independent application (two will require specialised hardware)
Explanation/overview of the functionalities of TONALITIES (documentation and screenshots?). Key figures on the number of works, analyses, theoretical models taken into account. Summary table of analytical information for each work, group of works taken into account. Links to the TONALITIES infrastructure.
Information about the meaning that certain sounds (the sounds of bells in our case) have contributed to creating a sense of identity and belonging of people to their territories and their traditions
Ranking of similarities based on known categories (performances of the same composition, covers songs, and all the possible example that can be identified based on previously known property that would be expected); Comparison to human performances.
The dispersion of sources is quite high. To solve this problem a corpus design has been made in which each textual type corresponds to a percentage of material in order to make the coprus representative
Musical encounters to be retrieved and explored alongside other knowledge
Larger user base, interface feedback and improvement, but also discussion on classification results.
We could incoporate such ideas in the final pilot, but it's not the core of what we presented in the proposal.
Yes
Cultural studies in music: a systematic study of music and childhood in the reference period is still to be done. State of art knowledge extraction methods can partly be used (eg. named entity recognition) but new research is needed to support factual information extraction such as event extraction and characterization for the domain of interest.

Not applicable (N/A)
Data extraction is mostly done. We can provide a preliminary interface to explore the extracted knowledge graph. Also a prototype of the dashboard can be presented.
Compliance to the standards is insured by relying on ElasticSearch as a back-end layer.Number of partners or external institution/people using it. KPI : github forks (collaboration), Docker image downloads, number of verified installations in other institutions than cnam.
we will rely on partial results from WP2 with ontologies (same answer as before, ontologies produce categories, and they are used as tools).
A demonstrator: a search engine query page and some result pages.
We may rely on interpretations, but I guess we would be "users" of such interpretations, not "creators" of them.
Possibly in WP8

Ontologies; linking algorithms; music context knowledge graphs; music similarity methods;
We need to establish Entity categories/hierarchy.Parts - wholes. Specific stops (e.g. Prestant and Flute both are 'stops').
An overview of resources and results. The possibility of articulating these elements with the other pilots. For example a monodic work that would have been analyzed in both TONALITIES and TUNES, etc. 
Potentially via reports, images ,videos.
Not yet clear. In any case we need tailored named entity recognition.
Sources from MusicBo may contribute data about Bologna and the CHILD pilot may include texts that could be used to extract encounters as well.

 - Use a test corpus (c. 150 works) and check whether the attributions made by the theorists can be inferred from the models.- Use a test corpus of multi-layered analyses (c. 15 works which have more than 1 analysis) and check if the information layers are stored correctly - Should we use the justification for the modal inference produced by the reasoner as metrics ?
For this particular pilot, the portal will be not be a major focus of interaction.

Yes, we have API SPARQL (customizable query). For photographies we have API IIIF (Internationale Image Interoperability Framework)
For professionals a quick way to find relations between (parts of) organs. For interested wider public an exploration space to discover instruments, music, recordings, maybe concerts, and the like.
To  be determined
Currently not planned.
Probably no, we focus on factual knowledge.
Tool: a web dashboard to support historiographical methodology.
Depends on what is meant with a 'source'.
Possibly
The tool should be easy to use. Search-engine is now widespread, so we should provide an interface similar to standard ones. The tool should be efficient, ie, retrieve relevant content based on the provided queries, rather quickly. The accessibility (e.g., for disabled people) will be derived from standard web technologies.
The SotA on search-engine for musical scores is rudimentary, and was mostly started by our team. We aim at extending previous preliminary theoretical work and produce working implementations.
Better understanding of appropriate technologies, tools, approaches, and their effects.
Through LOD
No
Yes, we want the socio-cultural context to be explicitly represented.
Tonalities aims to compare different (and even controversial) music analyses that MUST be referred to specific theoretical frameworks. In this way, the pilot innovates by contextualising theoretical and analytical information. ​The open linked data paradigm allows to articulate different large digital collections of notated music and to explore them through a quantitative-qualitative approach.​By modelling different theories and applying them to musical works in a dedicated interface combining machine learning and human annotations, we can analyse larger score collections and deepen our understanding of them.​
Data quality and Data consistency are guaranteed by Copus design built with the help of two expert musicologists
The analytical annotation interface and the semantic model will be suitable for collaborative work. 
Tonalities' main topic is the modal-tonal identification, exploration and classification of monophonic and polyphonic notated music from the Renaissance to the 20th century.  ​The pilot aims to: ​ better understand the evolution of the musical language and of its theories;​ share and to compare existing musical analyses;​ provide a tool for the analytical exploration of large music collections and for the modal-tonal classification of works.​
