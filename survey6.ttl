The pilot aims to investigate the intrinsic complexity of this heritage with an interdisciplinary approach, its cultural dimension in relation to a wider culture of sounds and listening, and the correlation of knowledge, practices and symbolic orders that preside over this dimension, with particular attention to the ethno-anthropological and ethnomusicological perspectives. The research will be articulated through two different lines of investigation: i) recovery, possible digitization and analysis of sound, audiovisual and written sources, already existing in collections and archives, ii) field surveys and catalogation of bell towers, bells, bell sound recordings,  performing practices and related knowledge. In particular, we will consider: the nature of the bell as a music instruments, the social actors traditionally involved in performing practices, the execution techniques and the performances and their interconnections and developments over time and space.

The pilot aims to investigate the intrinsic complexity of this heritage with an interdisciplinary approach, its cultural dimension in relation to a wider culture of sounds and listening, and the correlation of knowledge, practices and symbolic orders that preside over this dimension, with particular attention to the ethno-anthropological and ethnomusicological perspectives. The research will be articulated through two different lines of investigation: i) recovery, possible digitization and analysis of sound, audiovisual and written sources, already existing in collections and archives, ii) field surveys and catalogation of bell towers, bells, bell sound recordings,  performing practices and related knowledge. In particular, we will consider: the nature of the bell as a music instruments, the social actors traditionally involved in performing practices, the execution techniques and the performances and their interconnections and developments over time and space.
